HTML::PopupTreeSelect version 1.5
=================================

This module creates an HTML popup tree selector.  The HTML and
Javascript produced will work in Mozilla 1+ (Netscape 6+) on all
operating systems, Microsoft IE 5+ and Safari 1.0.  For an example,
visit this page:

I based the design for this widget on the xTree widget from WebFX.

CHANGES

1.5 
    - Added the ability to resize the chooser by dragging the lower
      edge.  This is off by default but may be turned on using the
      new 'resizable' option.  (Zac Shepard and Peter Leonard)

    - Fixed a few HTML and CSS standards-compliance problems.
      (Don Brodale)
