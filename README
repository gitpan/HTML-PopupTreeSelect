HTML::PopupTreeSelect version 1.1
=================================

This module creates an HTML popup tree selector.  The HTML and
Javascript produced will work in Mozilla 1+ (Netscape 6+) on all
operating systems and Microsoft IE 5+ on Windows and Mac.  For an
example, visit this page:

I based the design for this widget on the xTree widget from WebFX.
You can find it here:

CHANGES

    - Fixed bug where IE sometimes decided to wrap rows.

    - Changed code to setup form_field before calling onselect
      handler.  This allows the onselect handler to submit a form
      with the value already set.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then copy the images in images/ into a place here your web server can
find them.  Remember where you put them so you'll know what value to
set for image_path when you call new().

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  HTML::Template 2.6
  Test::More
  Carp
