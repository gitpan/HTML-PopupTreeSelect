HTML::PopupTreeSelect version 1.6
=================================

This module creates an HTML popup tree selector.  The HTML and
Javascript produced will work in Mozilla 1+ (Netscape 6+) on all
operating systems, Microsoft IE 5+ and Safari 1.0.  For an example,
visit this page:

I based the design for this widget on the xTree widget from WebFX.
You can find it here:

CHANGES

1.6
    - Fixed bug in Firefox and Camino on Mac OSX.  Scrollbars would
      stay visible after the widget was hidden. (Don Brodale)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then copy the images in images/ into a place here your web server can
find them.  Remember where you put them so you'll know what value to
set for image_path when you call new().
