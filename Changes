Revision history for Perl extension HTML::PopupTreeSelect.

1.0 Wed Apr 30 17:32:21 2003
    - First Release

1.1
    - Fixed bug where IE sometimes decided to wrap rows.

    - Changed code to setup form_field before calling onselect
      handler.  This allows the onselect handler to submit a form
      with the value already set.

1.2
    - Added ability to drag the widget around the window.

    - Added dropshadow in Windows IE.

    - Added workaround for the select-box show-through problem.

    - Added scrollbars to the widget.

    - NOTE: the default CSS has changed.  If you are using your own
      CSS you'll need to adjust it.  Just run the widget with
      include_css turned on and you'll see the new classes and settings.
