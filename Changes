Revision history for Perl extension HTML::PopupTreeSelect.

1.0 Wed Apr 30 17:32:21 2003
    - First Release

1.1
    - Fixed bug where IE sometimes decided to wrap rows.

    - Changed code to setup form_field before calling onselect
      handler.  This allows the onselect handler to submit a form
      with the value already set.
